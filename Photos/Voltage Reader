The PCB that was created in Eagle and physically created using Thompson Rivers University's milling machine.
The components were soldered on afterwards.

The LED that changed color based on voltage level detected.

Note that this was my first time soldering, so the connections are quite messy and the component placement was not optimal since it was my first exposure to PCB layout. But it did function as expected where the LED changed color as the voltage supply level was changed.
